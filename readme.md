# Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks
This is Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks by Yixiang Xie for CS5330 Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision.

The code is written in Python with PyTorch and OpenCV on Visual Studio Code on macOS Sonoma 14.0 and run on Python 3.11.5.

# Run the code
To train a MNIST network, run ```python3 ./train.py```. This should build and train a new deep network and save the network to a file. To test the network on MNIST and your own handwritten data, run ```python3 ./test.py```. To examine the first layer of the network, run ```python3 ./examine.py```. To transfer the network to greek letters, run ```python3 ./transfer.py```. To explore parameters of the MNIST network, run ```python3 ./design.py```.

# Extensions
For extensions, I tried with more greek letters. Run ```python3 ./transfer.py``` to see the results.
